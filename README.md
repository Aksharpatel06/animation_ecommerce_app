#### 1. **Explicit Animation**
**Description:**
Explicit animations allow you to control the animation steps manually, providing a detailed and smooth animation experience for elements like rotating planets or moving objects.

**Implementation Steps:**
- Use the `AnimationController` to manage the animation duration and control.
- Create `Animation` objects for different properties like rotation, scale, or position.
- Use `AnimatedBuilder` or `AnimatedWidget` to rebuild and animate widgets based on the animation values.

#### 2. **Implicit Animation**
**Description:**
Implicit animations simplify the animation process by automatically animating changes in widget properties, such as size, position, or color, making it easy to create smooth transitions.

**Implementation Steps:**
- Use implicit animation widgets like `AnimatedContainer`, `AnimatedOpacity`, and `AnimatedPositioned`.
- Define the target state changes and let Flutter handle the animation between states.
